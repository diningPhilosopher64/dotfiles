# dotfiles
One place for all dotfiles. If new PC/ or fresh OS. clone this repo and softlink

One place to update my config files for personal and work usage. 

### Notes for me:
* Source this .bashrc.sourabh in the /home/<username>/.bashrc
* Make the update_hardlinks.sh file executable and run once to update all softlinks for the config files
  * Will never overwrite existing files, renames existing files with timestamps.
